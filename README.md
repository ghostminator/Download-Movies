# Download-Movies
App to Search and Download Multiple Movies with Ease.

A Python app that allows users to search movies using the YTS API and open magnet links for torrents.
This App Searches the movie you entered and can select multiple movie files at once, then as you click fetch magnet, it redirects to your browser to download the movie .torrent files automatically that will download in your torrent manager app.
